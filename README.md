Exploring Variable Relationships and Subsetting in Statistical Analysis

In this analysis, we delve into the dataset provided by the instructor to uncover relationships between multiple variables. Using R-scripts, we conduct statistical tests and generate outputs under the Word file. The goal is to rigorously examine these relationships and communicate the findings effectively through labeled statistical outputs.

The first step involves creating dummy variables from appropriate categorical variables to subset the dataset. By re-running regression lines for the dependent variable, we investigate how these subsets influence the regression outcomes. The key focus here is to observe the impact of categorical variables on the regression analysis. Through scatterplots with multiple regression lines, we gain insights into how the categorical variable affects the regression relationship. This visual representation enhances our understanding of how the categorical factor influences the dependent variable in a multifaceted manner.

Additionally, further refine our analysis by creating separate regression lines for each subset derived from the categorical variable. By doing so, we gain a nuanced perspective on how different subsets contribute to the overall regression outcome. Comparing these regression lines with those from the initial analysis offers us a comprehensive view of how the data's characteristics vary across these subsets. Ultimately, this method enhances our comprehension of the dataset's intricacies and helps us draw more nuanced conclusions about the interplay between variables. Through these analytical steps, we aim to extract valuable insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the dataset's underlying relationships.
